Forecasting the Impact of US Real Interest Rate and Real Exchange Rate on Commodity Prices - Proxy SVAR Analysis. The exogenous variable in the SVAR model is the monetary policy shock. The composite commodities of interest include metals, food, and raw materials.

The R code includes the computation of impulse response functions (IRF) and Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD). The impulse response function illustrates how variables respond to external shocks, while the forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) explains the portion of forecast error variance of each variable attributable to exogenous shocks from other variables.
